Thanks for installing Rustlings!

Is this your first time? Don't worry, Rustlings was made for beginners! We are
going to teach you a lot of things about Rust, but before we can get
started, here's a couple of notes about how Rustlings operates:

1. The central concept behind Rustlings is that you solve exercises. These
   exercises usually have some sort of syntax error in them, which will cause
   them to fail compilation or testing. Sometimes there's a logic error instead
   of a syntax error. No matter what error, it's your job to find it and fix it!
   You'll know when you fixed it because then, the exercise will compile and
   Rustlings will be able to move on to the next exercise.
2. If you run Rustlings in watch mode (which we recommend), it'll automatically
   start with the first exercise. Don't get confused by an error message popping
   up as soon as you run Rustlings! This is part of the exercise that you're
   supposed to solve, so open the exercise file in an editor and start your
   detective work!
3. If you're stuck on an exercise, there is a helpful hint you can view by typing
   'hint' (in watch mode), or running `rustlings hint exercise_name`.
4. If an exercise doesn't make sense to you, feel free to open an issue on GitHub!
   (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new). We look at every issue,
   and sometimes, other learners do too so you can help each other out!
5. If you want to use `rust-analyzer` with exercises, which provides features like
   autocompletion, run the command `rustlings lsp`.

Got all that? Great! To get started, run `rustlings watch` in order to get the first
exercise. Make sure to have your editor open!
